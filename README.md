# File-Sorter

FileSorter is a Python script that automatically organizes files based on their extensions. It reads a list of filenames and their extensions from an Excel sheet, creates missing files if needed, and moves them into corresponding folders.

Features
	•	Reads filenames and extensions from an Excel sheet
	•	Creates missing files automatically
	•	Sorts files into folders based on their extension
	•	Uses shutil and pathlib for efficient file management

 How It Works
	1.	The script loads an Excel file containing filenames and extensions.
	2.	It creates folders for each unique extension in a specified main directory.
	3.	If a file doesn’t exist, the script creates it before moving it to the correct folder.
	4.	It moves the files into the appropriate folders based on their extensions.

Requirements
	•	Python 3.x
	•	pandas library
